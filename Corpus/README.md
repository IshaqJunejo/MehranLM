# Corpus

## Overview

This directory contains the corpus used in the project. It includes cleaned and some raw versions of the data.

## Directory Structure

- `**Cleaned/**`: This directory contains the processed files.
- `**Raw/**`: This directory contains the raw, unprocessed corpus files.
  - `**Large/**`, contains raw files that are too large for GitHub's file size limit; these have been placed in `.gitignore`.
- `**Private/**`: This has been placed in `.gitignore`
  - `**Cleaned/**`, this directory contains cleaned versions of private corpus.
  - `***Raw/*`, this directory contains raw versions of private corpus.
  - Although this directory doesn't serve any purpose yet, it is more of a future plan.
