# MehranLM

**MehranLM** is an experiemental attempt to build a **Small Language Model (SLM) for Sindhi**. 
It is currently supposed to be a submission for the GitHub's **For the Love of Code** hackathon. But as it likely won't be finished under the deadline, the vision is beyond the competition.
> To create a home-grown Sindhi language model that developers, students, and evetually the wider public can use, improve, and enjoy.

## Why MehranLM?

- **Lack of Sindhi support** - General or Multilingual LLM  perform poorly on Sindhi due to lack of data.
- **Local-first approach** - MehranLM is focued exclusively on Sindhi Language.
- **Community-driven** - Developers, students, and contributors are welcome to join hands in building the first-ever Sindhi language model.

## Audience

- **Students and Developers** - who want to experiement with language models and support Sindhi NLP.
- **Researchers** - (future scope) - to analyze, fine-tune, and evaluate a dedicated Sindhi Language Model.
- **General Public Use** - (future scope) - applications like text-completion, translation, or chatbots.
